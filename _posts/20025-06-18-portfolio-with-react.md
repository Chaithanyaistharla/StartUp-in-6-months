title: "Week 1 â€“ Building My Portfolio with React JS"
date: 2025-06-18
categories: react portfolio startup
---

Itâ€™s officially been **one week** since I began my journey to build a software service-based startup, and I kicked things off by working on one of the most important assets: **my personal portfolio website**.

As someone with a strong interest in UI/UX design and front-end development, I decided to build it using **React JS**. I wanted a responsive, clean, and interactive experience that reflects my design sensibility while being technically solid.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Chose React

Iâ€™ve previously worked with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, but this time I wanted:
- **Component-based structure** for easy scalability
- **Reusable UI blocks** for projects, skills, and contact sections
- A chance to sharpen my React fundamentals for future projects

---

## ðŸ§± My Portfolio Structure

Hereâ€™s how I structured the site:

- **Home Page** â€“ Brief intro with call-to-action
- **About Me** â€“ My background, education, and goals
- **Projects** â€“ Real projects with live links and GitHub repos
- **Skills** â€“ Tech stack visualized cleanly
- **Contact** â€“ Simple form with social links

I kept the design minimal, with a focus on typography, spacing, and contrast. Tailwind CSS helped a lot with styling speed.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries I Used

- `React` (via Vite for faster development)
- `React Icons` â€“ for professional-looking icons
- `Framer Motion` â€“ subtle animations
- `EmailJS` â€“ contact form integration
- `Tailwind CSS` â€“ utility-first styling
- `GitHub Pages` â€“ for free deployment

---

## ðŸš§ Challenges I Faced

- Getting the **mobile layout** perfect took more tweaking than expected
- Integrating **dark mode toggle** was fun but tricky
- Ensuring **SEO & performance** for a React-based static site

---

## âœ… What I Learned

- React hooks and component structure in depth
- Responsive design best practices
- The value of visual hierarchy in UI/UX
- How to deploy a React app to GitHub Pages

---

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?

In Week 2, I plan to:
- Start backend learning (Node.js, Express)
- Pick my startup niche and define core services
- Set up a project tracker using Notion
